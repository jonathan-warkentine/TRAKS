  ## Description:

  This app templatizes and automates the README generation process. Instead of the pain of trying to put together a good README, the user can get straight to work on their project and let this open source magic do its thing!

  ## Installation:

  You must have node installed on your machine in order to run this app. Run the command `npm i` to install the inquirer and fs dependencies.

  &nbsp;

  ## Usage:
  

  This app gives a series of prompts relating to the project at hand. A resulting README.md file is created within the ‘dist’ folder, within a folder with the same name as the project. Folders are automatically created where missing.
